Got it ‚Äî let‚Äôs break down what‚Äôs happening in your logs:

1. **Page analytics**:
   - ‚úÖ `page:time-on-page` and `page view` events are **successfully** sent to New Relic.
   - ‚úÖ `form:submit` event (for a **Stripe** payment) is also **successfully** tracked.

2. **Payment error**:
   - ‚ùå When the **payment** actually tries to happen (a **Stripe subscription** creation), it **fails**.
   - **Error:**  
     ```
     500: {"message":"Error creating subscription: Invalid time value"}
     ```

---

### What the real problem is:
- `"Invalid time value"` usually points to **bad date/time input**.
- In Stripe **subscription creation**, you often set:
  - `trial_end`
  - `billing_cycle_anchor`
  - or other **timestamp fields**.
- If you pass a **wrong format** (e.g., a `string` like `"now"` or a broken date instead of a proper **Unix timestamp**), Stripe will reject it.
- Since it‚Äôs a `500` error (server error), **your server** tried to create a subscription but **sent bad data** to Stripe.

---

### How to fix this:
- Double-check what your backend is sending to Stripe during subscription creation.
- Especially look for fields like:
  ```json
  {
    "trial_end": "invalid",
    "billing_cycle_anchor": "invalid"
  }
  ```
- They should be **integers** (Unix timestamps), like `1714287015` ‚Äî **not strings** or invalid dates.

Example of a correct payload:
```json
{
  "customer": "cus_1234",
  "items": [{ "price": "price_abc" }],
  "trial_end": 1714287015 // correct UNIX timestamp
}
```

---

### Why might this happen with a **test card**?
When testing manually, some parts of your code (like "add 7 days trial") might accidentally miscompute or send `undefined`, `null`, or bad dates ‚Äî and Stripe still expects valid timestamps even in test mode.

---

**Quick Debug Checklist:**
- ‚úÖ Confirm all dates sent to Stripe are valid Unix timestamps (seconds, not milliseconds!).
- ‚úÖ Log the payload you send to Stripe before the API call.
- ‚úÖ Add fallback/defaults if your trial end or billing anchor is optional.

Would you like me to show an example Node.js (or any backend) snippet on how to safely create a Stripe subscription with proper timestamps? üöÄ  
(Just tell me which backend you use: Node, Python, PHP, etc.)
