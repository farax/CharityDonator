# Security Fix: Removed Hardcoded Stripe Keys

## Issue
GitHub push protection detected hardcoded Stripe test keys in commit 6af952d.

## Resolution
- Removed all hardcoded API keys from tests/setup.ts
- Updated test configuration to use only environment variables
- Ensured no secrets are exposed in the codebase

## Files Modified
- tests/setup.ts: Updated to use environment variables exclusively

## Verification
All Stripe keys are now sourced from environment variables:
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
- VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
- STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET

The application maintains full functionality while following security best practices.
